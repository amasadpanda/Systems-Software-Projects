Scanner

How to compile the Scanner:
"gcc Scanner.c"
  Note: Although the executable can be named anything, it is prefered for it to be named "scanner"

How to run the Virtual Machine:
"./a.out <program_file>"
  Note: replace "a.out" with the name of the executable, preferably "scanner"
  
The program takes a single argument, the name of file in which the PL/0 code is stored.
This file should be in the same directory as the compiled Scanner program.

The program first reads in the file, then prints out any errors.
If no errors are found, two files are generated.
The first file, "output", contains the lexemes list that is generated.
The second file, "lexemes", contains the lexemes tables that is used to generate the output.

At the very end, the contents of the source program, the output, and the lexemes file will be printed out.
