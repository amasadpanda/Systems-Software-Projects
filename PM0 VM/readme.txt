How to compile the Virtual Machine:
"gcc PMachine.c"

How to run the Virtual Machine:
"./a.out <program_file>"

The program takes a single argument, the name of file in which the PL/0 code is stored.
This file should be in the same directory as the compiled PMachine program.
Assuming that gcc uses the generic name for compiled programs - a.out
