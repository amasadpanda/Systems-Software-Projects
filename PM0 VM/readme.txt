How to compile the Virtual Machine:
"gcc PMachine.c"

How to run the Virtual Machine:
The program takes a single argument, the name of file in which the PL/0 code is stored.
This file should be in the same directory as the compiled PMachine program.
  -in Eustis, this should be "./a.out <program_file>" assuming default name has assigned to the compiled program.
    - <program_file> is the file with the PL/0 code.
